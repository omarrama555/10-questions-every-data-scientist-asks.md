# 🤯 10 Questions Every Data Scientist Asks (And Honest Answers)

Whether you're just starting out or knee-deep in models, these questions haunt most data scientists at some point 👇

---

### 1. 🧼 Should I spend more time cleaning data or building models?
> Truth: 70-80% of a data scientist’s time goes to cleaning. It’s boring, but garbage in = garbage out.

---

### 2. 📊 Which model should I use? Logistic Regression or Random Forest or Neural Network?
> Answer: Start simple. Use logistic regression first. Only go complex if simple doesn’t work.

---

### 3. 🤖 Do I need to learn deep learning to get a job?
> Nope. Unless you're applying to very specific AI roles. Most real-world projects run on classical ML.

---

### 4. 💻 Is Python better than R?
> For most jobs: Python. It's more popular, has more libraries, and better integration with production systems.

---

### 5. ⏱ How much time should I spend on EDA?
> Enough to understand the data story. But don’t get stuck forever making pretty plots.

---

### 6. 🧪 How do I know if my model is "good enough"?
> Compare multiple metrics (accuracy, F1, ROC AUC), not just one. Also, compare to a baseline model.

---

### 7. 📁 Where should I host my portfolio projects?
> GitHub + one live demo (like Streamlit or Gradio). Don’t just post notebooks with no explanation.

---

### 8. 🤝 Do I need to learn SQL and data engineering?
> 100% yes. Data scientists often work with raw data and must write queries or build data pipelines.

---

### 9. 🧠 Should I learn everything (NLP, CV, time series, etc.)?
> Learn basics of all, specialize in one area you like. No one knows it all.

---

### 10. 🎯 Am I good enough?
> If you're learning, practicing, and asking questions like these — YES, you are.
